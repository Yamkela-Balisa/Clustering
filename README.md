Implement the K-means clustering algorithm [Jin and Han, 2010] with a Euclidean distance metric. 

Use K-mean to cluster data into 3 clusters. Initial clusters have given centriods (in the code, initial centriods are given).

Also, calculate the iterations needed for the k-means algorithm to converge. 

Results (cluster and final convergent centriod) of each iteration are output into a file called Cluster.txt.
